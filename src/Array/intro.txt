âœ… What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory.

ðŸ”¹ Characteristics of Arrays
Property	Description
Fixed Size	You define its size at creation.
Same Type	All elements must be of the same data type (e.g., int, String).
Indexed	You access elements using an index starting from 0.
Contiguous Memory	All elements are stored next to each other in memory.
ðŸ§  Why Use Arrays?
Fast Access: O(1) time for accessing by index.

Simple & Efficient for storing and manipulating collections of data.

Used as the base for many advanced data structures.


Declaring and Creating Arrays in Java
int[] arr = new int[5];           // Creates [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
String[] names = new String[3];  // Creates [null, null, null]

int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};       // Direct initialization

ðŸ”¸ Accessing & Modifying Elements

System.out.println(nums[2]); // Access â†’ prints 3

nums[2] = 10;                // Modify â†’ changes nums[2] from 3 to 10

ðŸ”¸ Traversing an Array
âœ… Using for loop
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(nums[i]);
}

âœ… Using for-each loop
for (int num : nums) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
ðŸ“Œ Time Complexities of Common Operations

Operation	Time Complexity
Access by index	O(1)
Insert at end	O(1) (if space)
Insert at index	O(n)
Delete at index	O(n)
Search	O(n) (linear), O(log n) (binary)
