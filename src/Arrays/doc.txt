1. What is an Array ? Why do we need an Array ?
        Note: Before going to array ref variable and datatype

        - When object creation is not there it is primitive
        - When Object creation is there it is non-primitive

        - In primitive there is no need to create object.

        - Non-primitive datatypes are
            * Class
            * Arrays
            * Collections

        - To store multiple value we need an array.
        - In primitive we can store only one value.
                int rollNumber = 101;
                int rollNumbers = 101, 102, 103; // we cannot

      **> An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
            - Before creating array u need to mention which type data you are going to store.(int, char,boolean etc)
            - Mention the length of data , Mention how many values we are going to store.
