	* What is access modifier ?
		Access modifiers defines the scope/visibility/restriction level of the members of a class ( variables , constructors and methods ).
	* List of access modifiers ?
	    They are four modifiers
	        1. public
	        2. private
	        3. protected
	        4. default ( no modifier ) ( package-private )
	* Usage of access modifiers ?
		public
			we can be access everywhere
			within class ,out side the class
			another class, subclasses, within package, outside the package, within the package
			outside the project.

			It can give to class, constructor, method, variable

		private
			we can access only within the class.
			we cannot access out side class ,  within package, outside the package, within the package
            outside the project.

            It can give to  constructor, method, variable

        default
            we can access within the class, outside the class , within the package, within subclass which is in same package.
            we cannot access out side the package ,outside the package subclasses, within project, outside the project
			It can give to class, constructor, method, variable
			
		protected
		we can access within the class, outside the class , within the package, within subclass which is in same package.
        we cannot access out side the package , within project, outside the project

		same as default but we can access outside the package subclasses we can access which is not possible in default

		 It can give to  constructor, method, variable


	* Access Levels


	Notes: - class never can be a private because
	if you give private to a class it cannot uses the class within itself or we cannot call the class within in, which is not possible
	Mainly we create class for use another place, by giving private it cannot be possible
