  * What is an abstract class ?
	  An abstract class is a class which can obtain the abstract methods, it is defined
	  wth the key word abstract.

		Before Java 1.8 means Java 1.7

		we cannot implement methods in interface to deal with they made abstract class

		In subclass there is no need to implement all the abstract methods ina interface
		For those abstract methods we handle in abstract class

		Ex:-    we have an interface with 10 abstract methods
				I have a subclass name Class1 can need only 5 methods remaining % methods it can't or on need
				To deal with it we create a 3rd party which means abstract class.

				This abstract key word makes java complier not through error if any abstract method is not implemented



  * When to use & how to use/create an abstract class ?

  * Can we create an instance of abstract classes ?
     No, we cannot create instance of abstract classes.
      we cannot create object using abstract class

  * Can we have non-abstract methods inside abstract class ?
	Yes , we can

  * Can we extend multiple abstract classes into a single class ?
    No, multiple inhertance cannot be possible in class

  * Can we implement the abstract class like an interface ?
	No, we cannot use keyword like interface in abstract class.




 Note:-  Abstract is a Non Accessible Modifier | Non Access Modifier
         Non Access Modifier means which not define any scope |filled etc
