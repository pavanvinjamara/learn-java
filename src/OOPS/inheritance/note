Inheritance - Is is a principle in OOPs for reusability of code.
code reusability favours readability, manageability & performance

Agenda
	* What is Inheritance ?
		Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviours of
		another class with the specific relationship.

		ex: - for relationship Parent - child
			- parent class to child class (correct)
		in java we call them like
			  super class to sub class
		we cannot inherit sun class properties in super class


	* Types of Inheritance ?
		we have two type inheritance
			1. multi-level inheritance,
			2. multiple inheritance.

		In classes we cannot perform multiple inheritance, only by using Interface we can perform this.
		why we cannot perform in class ?
		Because when we create object we both same methods but think little bit different operation
		when we call the method using object java confuses which method we need to use

	* Implementation of inheritance with Interfaces ?
		 difference between class and interface in class for every method we provide
		 implementation.

		 implementation is based on curly brackets {}.
		 if we not giving curly braces before method that is we are not implementing.


	* Super keyword ?
