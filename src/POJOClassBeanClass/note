	* What is a POJO class ?
		POJO means Plain Old Java Object.
		It is a simple java object, which is not bounded by any special restriction

	* Rules for a class to be called as a POJO class ?
			(*) MEANS COMPULSORY RULES

	  (*) -> It must be public.(CLASS)
	      -> It is recommended to make the properties (instance variables) as
	         private for improved security.
	      -> It can have Getters & Setters in order to access the properties.
	  (*) -> It shouldn't implement any interfaces.
	  (*) -> It shouldn't extend any classes.
	  (*) -> It shouldn't have any annotations specified.( @Override annotation )

	* Example for POJO class ?

	* What is a Java Bean Class ?
		Java Bean class is an extended version of a POJO class.
		It is also referred as a serializable POJO class.

	* Rules for a clas to be called as a Java Bean ?
		ALL ARE COMPULSORY

    		-> It should implement serializable interface.
    		-> It should have a no-args constructor
    		-> All the properties (instance variables ) should be private.
    		-> It should have Getters & Setters (public) in order to access the properties.


	* Example of Java Bean class ?

	* Differences between POJO Class & Java Bean ?

		Normal cases we use POJO class

		For Java Bean Class real world example
		we are implementing the serializable interface
		we use that interface for communication between application layer(backend code) and database layer
		To communication we need to send java object through stream to database
		for that we use  serializable interface and get the data from database we deserializable.

		for network reason we need to use Java Bean class or else POJO we can use

	Note:- Why we need to use POJO class
			Suppose we are creating a multiple Employee Data
			To create that data and maintain that data we use POJO class.
			By creating this we can use this class as a variable to create employees.
