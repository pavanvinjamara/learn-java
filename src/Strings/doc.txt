1. What is a String?
    => String is a sequence of characters (text means which includes all characters numerics etc.) and it is a class in java but considered as a literal because of its unique behaviour.
        Unique behaviour means
            normal we declare a variable using datatype using keyword like int, float etc.
            But string is not a datatype it is a class we use like variable declaration.
            - String is a non-primitive datatype to say in java we say literal.
            - We need string to store text or handle text.
            - String is a non-primitive because class is a non-primitive, and string is a class; that's why it is non-primitive.

2. Different ways to create a string?
    => We can create string two types
        - String s1 = "hello";
        - String s2 = new String("hello");
