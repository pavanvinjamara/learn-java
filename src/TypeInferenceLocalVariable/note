 * What is type inference ?
    Type Inference is a concept in which the compiler infers the type of
    the variable using the value provided.

    This type inference is restricted to local variables.
    this feature is introduced in java 10n version.
 what is local variable ?
  A variable is created within a block level not class level is called local variable.
  ex: - a variables created in block | method | constructor

 * How to use var keyword ?

 * var keyword restrictions ?
    => we cannot use in static variables.
    => cannot use in class level variables.
    =>  we cannot use without initialization.

    => var can only be used in the local variables.
    => var can't be used for only declaration purpose, instead it should be used along with initialisation.
    => when used with arrays, should not use the brackets.
    => var can't be used in In-line array initialisation without specifying the datatype.
    => cannot use in the parameters also.
