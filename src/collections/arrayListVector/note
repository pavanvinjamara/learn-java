	* What is a List ?
	* Hierarchy of List Interface in java ?
	* Implementation of ArrayList and Vector ?
	* How to use ArrayList ?
	* How to use Vector ?
	* Important points to remember
	------Vectors-----
		-> What is the default capacity ?
		    10 is the default size
		-> What is the initial capacity ?
			initial is 10 if we give any number in constructor or depends on insertion array length it make array length double.
		-> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
			Yes
		-> Does it allow null values ?
			Yes
		-> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
			True
		-> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
			False
		-> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
			Yes
		-> Is it synchronised ?
			Yes , It encourage single thread only does at a time single work
		-> What is it good at ?
			In Multi threading or data is increasing in exponentially
			To store data, retrieve the data
			In multi threading also it will handle one after other task

	------ArrayList-----
    		-> What is the default capacity ?
    		    0 is the default size
    		-> What is the initial capacity ?
    			10
    		-> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
    			Yes
    		-> Does it allow null values ?
    			Yes
    		-> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
    			True
    		-> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
    			False
    		-> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
    			Yes
    		-> Is it synchronised ?
    			No , By using collections class we can make it synchronised.
    		-> What is it good at ?
    			data is not increasing in exponentially ,
    			To store data, retrieve the data
    			In multi threading also it will handle one after other task


Note:- ArrayList class & Vector class both implements List Interface (check image)

Note :- Arraylist increases length with 50% and vector increases length with 100%
		if not consider decimal means if our array length is 15. 50 percent of length is 7.5,
		In this case it consider 7 only.

	 :- In multi threading Arraylist is fast and vector is slow
	    because vector handle one after other and arraylist handle all at a time.

	    Memory allocation difference vector by default it create
	    capacity 10 but arraylist creates after adding element.

		Vector is legacy class and arraylist is collections class.


Major Operations
	-> Creation of List
	-> Addition of elements into the list
	-> Retrieval of elements from the list
	-> Deletion of elements in the list
	-> Verification of elements in the list
	-> Updating of elements in the list
