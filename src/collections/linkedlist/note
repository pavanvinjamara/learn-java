Agenda
	-> LinkedList implements two interfaces which are List Interface and Deque Interface.
	-> LinkedList is a combination of multiple node object
	-> We create node object using node class and it consists of prev, data and next properties.
	-> prev and next store address of another node object or null.

	-> When we created a linked list it's size is 0, It's firstNode is null and
	   It's lastNode is null.
	-> When we adding element above three will update. and firstNode and lastNode contains address of that node.
	-> LinkedList cannot be created with pre-defined size.

	* Hierarchy of List Interface in java ?
	* What is a LinkedList ?
	* Implementation of LinkedList ?
	* How to use LinkedList ?
	* Important points to remember ?

	-> What is the default capacity ?
        0 is the default size
    -> What is the initial capacity ?
        0
    -> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
        Yes
    -> Does it allow null values ?
        Yes
    -> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
        True
    -> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
        False
    -> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
        Yes
    -> Is it synchronised ?
        No , By using collections class we can make it synchronised.
    -> What is it good at ?
        data is not increasing in exponentially ,
        Manipulating data , inserting data, deleting data
        In multi threading also it will handle one after other task




Major Operations
	-> Creation of List
	-> Addition of elements into the list
	-> Retrieval of elements from the list
	-> Deletion of elements in the list
	-> Verification of elements in the list
	-> Updating of elements in the list
