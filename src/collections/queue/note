	* What is a Queue?
		Queue is a class in java which extends the collection interface
        and also represents the FIFO principle.
        FIFO - First In First Out

	* Hierarchy of Queue Interface in Java ?
	* How to use Queue ?
	* Important points to remember ?

	---------- Priority Queue ----------
	    -> What is the default capacity ?
            11
        -> What is the initial capacity ?
            11
        -> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
            Yes
        -> Does it allow null values ?
            No
        -> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
            No
        -> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
            No
        -> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
            No
        -> Is it synchronised ?
            No
        -> What is it good at ?
            good for first in first out ,

        ----------  ArrayDeque ----------
            -> What is the default capacity ?
                17
            -> What is the initial capacity ?
                17
            -> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
                Yes
            -> Does it allow null values ?
                No
            -> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
                No
            -> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
                No
            -> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
                No
            -> Is it synchronised ?
                No
            -> What is it good at ?
                good for first in first out ,




	Major Operations
    	-> Creation of Queue
    	-> Addition of elements into the Queue
    	-> Retrieval of elements from the Queue
    	-> Deletion of elements in the Queue
    	-> Verification of elements in the Queue


    note :- Priority queue is not maintain sorted order internally.
            but head is the highest priority element.
            In Integers we have the low number have the highest priority.
