In general stack is like jar or vertical
we need to imagine vertical it becomes easy
index 0 is starts from bottom.

Stack introduce in java 1.0, It is a legacy class.

Note:- Stack class extends Vector class (check image)
 Stack is a class in java which implements the list interface and extends the vector class
 and also represents the LIFO principle.

 Special Methods available in stack
    * push   - adds element at last
    * pop    - remove element from first
    * peek   - shows the last added element
    * search - It search from top and return where it finds it that number it gives


    -> What is the default capacity ?
        10 is the default size
    -> What is the initial capacity ?
        10
    -> Does it allow duplicate elements ?
        Yes
    -> Does it allow null values ?
        Yes
    -> Does it maintain the insertion order ?
        True
    -> Does it maintain the sorted order ?
        False
    -> Does it offer the random access of elements ?
        Yes, but we should not use that methods
    -> Is it synchronised ?
        Yes, By using collections class we can make it synchronised.
    -> What is it good at ?
        good for last in first out ,
        undo and redo application,
        browser forward and backward,
        related to recursion,



Major Operations
	-> Creation of Stack
	-> Addition of elements into the stack
	-> Retrieval of elements from the stack
	-> Deletion of elements in the stack
	-> Verification of elements in the stack
	-> Updating of elements in the stack
