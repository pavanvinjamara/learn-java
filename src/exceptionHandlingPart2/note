	* Try with resources
		When we use resources reader writer etc when need to close them after use using close method.
		To make it automatic means java itself close the resource, we use try with resources.
		Using try block we can perform try(<---resource--->){
		}catch(Exception ex){}

		Only the classes which can be implements AutoClosable Interface that class object we can pass in try block.
		After using also we can use close method also but no needed , because internal it will call this method.

	* Multiple catch blocks
	* Multiple exceptions in a single catch block ?
	* When will the finally block not be executed ?
		If we use System.exit(0);
        It destroys the thread because od that below this line no code will be executed.

	* Throw custom(user defined) exceptions using throw keyword ?


	Note :- We have multiple exceptions to handle you use throws keyword and exception names with comma separated.
			To Keep it simple and handle you can use Exception || Throwable
			so, it can handle multiple exceptions because they are parent classes.
