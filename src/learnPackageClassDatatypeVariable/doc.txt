--------------------------- *  PACKAGE  * ------------------------

1. What is a package ?
 => Package is a conatiner which can segregate the files in the java project

2. Understand the need for a package in project ?
3. Different ways to create a package ?


--------------------------- *  CLASS  * ----------------------------
1. What is class ?

2. How do we create a class ?

3. What are the different options that we have creating a class ?

4. What are the members of a class ?

--------------------------- *  DATA TYPE  * ----------------------------
1. What is a data type ?
   => A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data

2. Categorisation of data types ?
    => Two types
       1. Primitive
            * Number(Call has Numeric)
                --> Integer Type
                        // Wrapper Class ==> Outer layer of datatype to perform operation (Ex :- Byte, FLoat, Long etc).
                                            --- (check memory units) ---
                        ~ Byte     --> byte        -      1 byte
                        ~ Short    --> short       -      2 bytes
                        ~ Integer  --> int         -      4 bytes
                        ~ Long     --> long        -      8 bytes
                --> Decimal Type
                        ~ Float    --> float       -      4 bytes
                        ~ Double   --> double      -      8 bytes

            * Boolean
                                   --> boolean     -      1 bit

            * Character
                                   --> char        -      2 bytes
       2. Non-Primitive
            => Non-primitive which is not a predefined datatype and which don't have predefined size.
            => Non-primitive data types (also called reference types) in Java are types that refer to objects and do not store the actual value, but instead store the memory address (reference) where the object is located.
            * Arrays

            * Collections

            * Interface

            * Class

      ******************** Computer Memory units ***********************
      ===> bit = Binary digit
      ===> 1 Nibble = 4 bits
      ===> 1 Byte = 8 bits
      ===> 1 Kilo byte (KB) = 1024 bytes
      ===> 1 Mega byte (MB) = 1024 Kilo bytes
      ===> 1 Giga byte (GB) = 1024 Mega bytes
      ===> 1 Tera byte (TB) = 1024 Giga bytes
      ===> 1 Peta byte (PB) = 1024 Tera bytes

3. What are the Primitive data types available in Java ?

4. What is the default value & size of each primitive data type ?

5. What are the Non-Primitive data types in Java ?


--------------------------- *  VARIABLE  * ----------------------------

1. What is a variable ?
    => A variable is a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program. A variable definition (or declaration) tells the compiler:

2. Different type of variables in java ?
    => In Java, variables are categorized based on where they are declared and how they behave.
    There are three main types of variables:

        ------> GLOBAL VARIABLES
        * Instance Variables (Non-static fields)
            - Declared inside a class, but outside any method.

            - Belong to each object (instance) of the class.

            - Get default values if not initialized (e.g., 0, null, false).

        * Static Variables (Class variables)
            - Declared with the static keyword.

            - Belong to the class rather than any object.

            - Shared by all instances of the class.

        ----------> LOCAL VARIABLES
        * Local Variables
            - Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.

            - Only accessible within that method or block.

            - Not assigned default values â€” must be initialized before use.
        * Parameters
            - A parameter is a variable used to receive values (called arguments) when a method is called.
              It acts like an input to the method.

            - Term	        Description

              Parameter	    The variable defined in the method declaration
              Argument	    The actual value passed when calling the method

3. How to access the variable data/value ?

4. Naming conventions for variable ?
    => Variables are case-sensitive
    => for single word use lowerCase,if you have multiple words use camelCase(firstSecond).
    => We cannot use keywords has variable names.
    => we can use only this special characters ( _, $ )in variable name in java. oracle recommend don't use at starting place.
    => UnderScore is used for const value. (float MATH_PIE = 3.14;)
