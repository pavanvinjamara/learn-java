1. what is an operator ?
    => Operator is a symbol that perform operations on variables and values.

2. Different type of operation in java ?
    => Mostly used operator
         - Arithmetic Operators
                Operation         -  Symbol
             -- Addition              (+)
             -- Subtraction           (-)
             -- Multiplication        (*)
             -- Dividion              (/)
             -- Modulus               (%)
         - Unary Operators
             -- Increment (++)
             -- Decrement (--)
                In this we two pre and post
                   -- Pre
                     --> ++value Pre-increment
                     --> --value Pre-decrement
                   -- Post
                    --> value++ Post-increment
                    --> value-- Post-decrement

         - Relational Operator
               Operation         -         Symbol
            -- Equal to                     (==)
            -- Not Equal to                 (!=)
            -- Greater than                 (> )
            -- Lesser than                  (< )
            -- Greater than Equal to        (>=)
            --  Lesser than Equal to        (<=)

         - Conditional Operators
              Operation         -         Symbol
           -- Conditional AND              (&&)
           -- Conditional OR               (||)

         - Assignment Operators
              Operation               -    Symbol
           -- Equal to                     (= )
           -- Plus Equal to                (+=)
           -- Minus Equal to               (-=)
           -- Multiply Equal to            (*=)
           -- Divide than Equal to         (/=)
           -- Remind than Equal to         (%=)
           we have more left shift and right shift also

3. Perform the operations using the operators ?
