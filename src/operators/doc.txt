1. what is an operator ?
    => Operator is a symbol that perform operations on variables and values.

2. Different type of operation in java ?
    => Mostly used operator
         - Arithmetic Operators
                Operation         -  Symbol
             -- Addition              (+)
             -- Subtraction           (-)
             -- Multiplication        (*)
             -- Dividion              (/)
             -- Modulus               (%)
         - Unary Operators
             -- Increment (++)
             -- Decrement (--)
                In this we two pre and post
                   -- Pre
                     --> ++value Pre-increment
                     --> --value Pre-decrement
                   -- Post
                    --> value++ Post-increment
                    --> value-- Post-decrement

         - Relational Operator
         - Conditional Operators
         - Assignment Operators

3. Perform the operations using the oprators ?
