1. What is static in java ?
    In java to execute anything, it should allocated with memory.
    => Here, To execute main method it should allocated with memory.
       To allocate memory we need to create object
       To create object we need to create class again for that we need memory.
       we fell into end less loop, To over come this java given an keyword static by using this we can create memory without creation of an object.

1. What is static in Java?

    In Java, members marked as static belong to the class, not to an individual object.

    Normally, to access a method or variable, an object of the class must be created.
    However, the main method must run before any object is created.

    If main were not static, Java would need an object to call it.
    To create that object, the class would need to be loaded first, which would again require executing code — leading to a logical dependency problem.

    To avoid this, Java provides the static keyword.

    A static method:

    Is loaded into memory when the class is loaded

    Can be accessed without creating an object

    Is shared by all objects of the class

    That’s why the main method is declared as static.
